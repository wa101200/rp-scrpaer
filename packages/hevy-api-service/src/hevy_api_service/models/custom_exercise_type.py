Hevy API Docs

       Welcome to Hevy's public API! We're just starting to roll this out and depending on your       feedback, we'll be adding more features and endpoints. Also, we make no guarantees that        we won't completely change the structure or abandon the project entirely so use it at       your own risk. Currently, this API is only available to Hevy Pro users. You can get your        key on our web app at https://hevy.com/settings?developer. If you have any questions,       please reach out to pedro@hevyapp.com 🤝.
