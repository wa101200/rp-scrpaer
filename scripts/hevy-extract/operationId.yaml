            description: Operations are the core of the contract, they define paths and HTTP methods. These rules check operations have been well constructed, looks for operationId, parameter, schema and return types in depth.

            name: Operations
        description: Every operation must contain an `operationId`.
        formats:

            - oas3_2
            - oas2
        given: $
        howToFix: Every single operation needs an operationId. It's a critical requirement to be able to identify each individual operation uniquely. Please add an operationId to the operation.
        id: operation-operationId
        recommended: true
        severity: error
        then:

            id: operations
            name: Operations
        description: Every operation must have unique `operationId`.
        formats:
            - oas3
            - oas3_1
            - oas3_2
            - oas2
        given: $.paths
        howToFix: An operationId needs to be unique, there can't be any duplicates in the document, you can't re-use them. Make sure the ID used for this operation is unique.
        id: operation-operationId-unique
        recommended: true
        resolved: true
        severity: error
        then:

            id: operations
            name: Operations
        description: OperationId must use URL friendly characters
        formats:
            - oas3
            - oas3_1
            - oas3_2
            - oas2
        given: $.paths[*][*]
        howToFix: An operationId is critical to correct code generation and operation identification. The operationId should really be designed in a way to make it friendly when used as part of a URL. Remove non-standard URL characters.
        id: operation-operationId-valid-in-url
        recommended: true
        resolved: true
        severity: error
